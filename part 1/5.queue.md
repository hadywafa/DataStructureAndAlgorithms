# Queue Data Structure

## Overview

- A **queue** is a data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. This means that the first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed.
- Think of a queue as a line of people waiting for a bus. The first person to arrive is the first to board the bus, and as more people join the line, they join at the back.

## Key Operations

1. **Enqueue:** `O(1)`

   - Adds an element to the back (rear) of the queue.

2. **Dequeue:** `O(1)`

   - Removes and returns the element from the front (front) of the queue.

3. **Peek (or Front):** `O(1)`
   - Returns the element at the front of the queue without removing it.
4. **IsEmpty** `O(1)`
   - check if the stack is empty or not.

## Characteristics

- **Ordering:**

  - Elements are added at the back and removed from the front, maintaining a strict order.

- **Usage:**

  - Suitable for scenarios where elements are processed in the order they arrive, such as task scheduling or print job queues.

- **Implementation:**

  - Can be implemented using arrays, linked lists, or other dynamic structures.

- **Applications:**
  - Task scheduling, print job queues, breadth-first search algorithms, and more.

## Example

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Queue<int> queue = new Queue<int>();

        queue.Enqueue(10);
        queue.Enqueue(20);
        queue.Enqueue(30);

        int frontElement = queue.Dequeue(); // Returns 10
        int newFrontElement = queue.Peek(); // Returns 20

        Console.WriteLine("Front Element after Dequeue: " + frontElement);
        Console.WriteLine("Front Element after Peek: " + newFrontElement);
    }
}
```

```cs
public string Reverse(string input){
    var stack = new Stack<string>();

 foreach (char char in input.ToArray())
 {
    
 }
}
```
