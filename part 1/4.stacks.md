# Stacks

## Overview

A **stack** is a data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. In other words, the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed.

## Key Operations

1. **Push**:

- Adds an element to the top of the stack.

1. **Pop**:

- Removes and returns the element from the top of the stack.

1. **Peek (or Top)**:

- Returns the element at the top of the stack without removing it.

## Usage

- implement the undo feature
- build compilers(eg. syntax checking)
- evaluate expressions(eg 1+2 \*3)
- build navigation(eg. forward/back)
